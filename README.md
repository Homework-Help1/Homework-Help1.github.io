## Key Features:
* Inventions: The Spinning Jenny, the Power Loom, and the steam engine were all invented during the Industrial Revolution
* Manufacturing: Goods were made by machines instead of by hand
* Production: Production increased, and prices decreased
* Migration: People moved from rural areas to cities
* Wages: Wages improved

## Inventions
* The Flying Shuttle
   - John Kay
   - 1730s
   - doubles amount of cotton cloth made in a day
* The Spinning Jenny
   - James Hargreaves
   - 1764
   - Could spin several threads at a time, however the thread was too thin, so it broke (the thread)
* Water Frame
   - Richard Arkwright
   - 1769
   - Steam power, rollers → to stretch thread before it was spun, tightly woven cotton fabric, durable
* Mule 
   - Samuel Orompton
   - Late 1700s
   - Steam powered, increased production of durable thread, 10 times faster than, Spinning Jenny + Water Frame = Mule

The Industrial Revolution was a period of scientific and technological development in the 18th century that transformed largely rural, agrarian societies—especially in Europe and North America—into industrialized, urban ones.
